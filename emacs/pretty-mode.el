;;; Commentary:

;; This idea is *completely* stolen from Luke Gorrie's pretty-lambda.el.  I'm
;; just curious to see how easily it can be done with font-locking alone.
;;
;; Modified by Dov Grobgeld to support changing lots of variables
;; to make python look like APL. This is probably a very bad idea, but
;; quite fun. :-)
