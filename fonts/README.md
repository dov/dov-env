# Fonts modified by me

## Inconsolata

Inconsolata is my prefered font for org-mode tables. I added the following characters that were missing in the default font.

* Copied greek glyphs from https://github.com/cosmix/Inconsolata-Hellenic.git
* Added summation sign: ∑
* Added logical operators: ∧ ∨ ∩ ∪
* Added right and left arrows: → ←

### TBD 

* Fix hinting of "Union" glyph.
